## Difference between Array and Linked List

| **Array**                                           | **Linked List**                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Collection of elements of **same data type**        | Collection of **nodes** (data + address)         |
| Stored in **contiguous memory locations**           | Stored in **non-contiguous (random) memory**     |
| **Fixed size** (static memory allocation)           | **Dynamic size** (memory allocated at runtime)   |
| Memory allocated at **compile time**                | Memory allocated at **run time**                 |
| **Direct access** possible using index → O(1)       | **Sequential access only** → O(n)                |
| Insertion & deletion are **slow** (shifting needed) | Insertion & deletion are **fast** (no shifting)  |
| Memory utilization can be **inefficient**           | Memory utilization is **efficient**              |
| Requires **less memory** (no extra pointer)         | Requires **extra memory** for pointer/reference  |
| Easy to implement                                   | More complex (pointer management)                |
| Resizing requires **copying elements**              | No resizing overhead                             |
| Suitable for **fixed-size & random access**         | Suitable for **dynamic data & frequent updates** |
| Binary search possible (if sorted)                  | Binary search **not possible**                   |
| Cache-friendly                                      | Less cache-friendly                              |
